# Mazemerized

This project is a hybrid between **DOTS (Data-Oriented Tech Stack)**, **MonoBehaviour**, and **XR Interaction Toolkit** in Unity.

It combines the performance advantages of Unity's ECS architecture with the flexibility of traditional MonoBehaviour scripts and the immersive capabilities of XR development.

## Features

- ECS components and systems using Unity DOTS
- MonoBehaviour scripts for UI, player input, and specific logic
- Integration with **XR Interaction Toolkit** for VR interactions
